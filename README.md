# Bab - Custom Commands for your Projects

**Zero dependencies. Cross-platform by design.**

Write custom commands in YAML, execute them with bab. Just like Makefile but with more features and Zero dependencies. (soon)

ITS PRE PRE ALPHA DO NOT USE IT FRFR

### TODOS
- [x] Last commands executed history
- [ ] Basic babfile schema
- [ ] Advanced nesting and multi Babfile support
- [ ] Platform flags for commands so you can define commands specifically for OS
- [ ] Binary Compile (so its not just shell and batch scripts)
- [ ] Babfile configs and environment variable handeling
- [ ] Homepage
- [ ] Being a good markdown/taskfile replacement

### IDEAS
- [ ] Performance profiling
- [x] Interactive mode (fuzzy search or something)
- [ ] Modules (multi babfile support in module format)
- [ ] Generate babfiles/generate and add new commands to babfile via forms
