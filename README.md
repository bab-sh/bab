## Overview
**Bab** is a modern task runner built for seamless development workflows.

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -sSfL https://bab.sh/install.sh | sh

```

### 2. Create a Babfile

Create a `Babfile` in your project root:

```yaml
setup:
  desc: Install dependencies
  run: npm install

dev:
  desc: Start development server
  run: npm run dev

test:
  desc: Run test suite
  run: npm test

build:
  desc: Build for production
  run: npm run build
```

### 3. Run Your Tasks

```bash
bab               # List all available tasks in the handy fuzzy finder
bab setup         # Run the setup task
bab dev           # Start development server
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# List all available tasks
bab

# Run a task
bab <task-name>

# Run nested tasks
bab <parent>:<child>

# Get help
bab --help

# Show version
bab --version
```

### Babfile Structure

A Babfile is a YAML file that defines your project's tasks. Here's the basic structure:

```yaml
# Simple task
task-name:
  desc: Description of what this task does
  run: command to execute

# Task with multiple commands
build:
  desc: Build the project
  run: |
    echo "Building..."
    go build -o app
    echo "Build complete!"

# Nested tasks
dev:
  start:
    desc: Start development server
    run: npm run dev

  test:
    desc: Run tests in watch mode
    run: npm run test:watch

# Task without description
quick-test:
  run: go test ./...
```

### Command Reference

```bash
# Basic commands
bab                              # List all tasks
bab <task>                       # Run a task
bab <parent>:<child>             # Run nested task

# Options
bab <task> --dry-run             # Show what would run without executing
bab <task> --verbose             # Show detailed output
bab --file custom.yaml <task>    # Use a custom Babfile
bab completion bash              # Generate bash completion script
bab completion zsh               # Generate zsh completion script
bab completion fish              # Generate fish completion script
